 The application uses React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces with efficiency and code reusability.
- **Styled Components**: [![style: styled-components](https://img.shields.io/badge/style-%F0%9F%92%85%20styled--components-orange.svg?colorB=daa357&colorA=db748e)](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components) Styled Components is a popular library for styling React components with a CSS-in-JS approach. It allows you to write CSS code directly within your JavaScript components, making it easier to manage and reuse styles in a component-based architecture.
- **styled-normalize**: [![style: styled-normalize](https://img.shields.io/badge/style-%F0%9F%93%8C%20styled--normalize-yellow.svg)](https://github.com/sergeysova/styled-normalize) Styled Normalize is a modern, normalized CSS reset built with styled-components.

It enables easy creation of multi-page apps with client-side navigation, dynamically updating content based on the URL.
- **react-icons**: [![library: react-icons](https://img.shields.io/badge/library-%E2%9D%A4%EF%B8%8F%20react--icons-%239f4686)](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) React Icons is a popular library that provides a collection of customizable icons for React applications.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
